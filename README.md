# automann_create_csv_from_po

Customer wanted to easily order items from automann.com based on purchase orders generated by PTM Vision.
PTM Vision saves data into Visual FoxPro tables.
Automann.com allows a cart to be filled using a csv file.
Either PTM Vision or Visual FoxPro denote a deleted item with Z*

This script queries the file po.dbf for all non-deleted items that haven't been ordered and are from the vendor ATM.
Sorts that data by part number, then creates a csv file in the format

part_number,qty_required

There are some weird edge cases where items with negative quantities can show up in the po file. After uploading the
file to Automann, the site will question you about such oddities.
